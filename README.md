# ComputerVision-project-CV-19
CV-19 classifier with RX-images

We have created a classifier that seems to outperform the state of the art for this dataset which contains the images of 4 types of pulnonal radiographs, 
classifying between viral pneumonia, pulmonary opacity, covid and normal. Using the proposed CNN structure in this work we have performed the classification of images in a dataset that we have previously balanced. 
And subsequently we have trained the classifier obtaining 93% accuracy.
